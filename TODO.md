- [x] Update Google Cloud libraries (v0.103 â†’ v0.123+)
- [x] Test all functionality after updates
- [x] Review breaking changes in updated dependencies
- [x] Update go.sum with new checksums

**Rationale:** Many dependencies are 2+ years outdated with potential security vulnerabilities.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
Major dependency updates:
- **google.golang.org/api**: v0.92.0 â†’ v0.251.0 (major version jump!)
- **github.com/spf13/cobra**: v1.5.0 â†’ v1.10.1
- **github.com/spf13/viper**: v1.12.0 â†’ v1.21.0

### 3. Add Testing
- [x] Add unit tests for helper functions (parsePhone, parseAddress, etc.)
- [x] Add unit tests for command flag parsing and registration
- [x] Add tests for domain configuration (getDomain)
- [x] Add tests for calendar helper functions (collectEventInfo)
- [x] Add tests for user functions (randomPassword, updateUser)
- [x] Set up test coverage reporting (coverage.out, coverage.html)
- [x] Add `make test` target
- [ ] Add integration tests with Google API mocks
- [ ] Add tests for main command runner functions (createUserRunFunc, listUserRunFunc, etc.)
- [ ] Add tests for group functions (displayGroupInfo, getGroupInfo)
- [ ] Add tests for client initialization functions (with mocked OAuth)
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage

**Rationale:** No test files exist currently. Testing is critical for reliability and maintenance.

**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress (23.6% coverage achieved)
Test files created:
- `cmd/user_test.go`: Tests for randomPassword, updateUser
- `cmd/root_test.go`: Tests for getDomain and root command flags
- `cmd/group_test.go`: Tests for group email construction
- `cmd/commands_test.go`: Tests for command registration and flags
- `cmd/user_update_test.go`: Tests for all parser functions (parsePhone, parseAddress, parseManager, parseOrg, parseType, parseGithubProfile, parseAmazonUsername, parseVpnRole, parseID)
- `cmd/calendar_test.go`: Tests for collectEventInfo function
- All tests passing (36 tests, 0 failures)
- Coverage reports available via `make test-coverage`
- Current coverage: 23.6% (started at 0%)

**Next Steps to Reach >80% Coverage:**
1. Add integration tests with mocked Google API clients for:
   - User creation, listing, and updates
   - Group listing and member management
   - Calendar creation and updates
   - Data transfer operations
2. Add tests for command runner functions (currently 0% coverage)
3. Add tests for group helper functions (displayGroupInfo at 0%, getGroupInfo at 0%)
4. Add tests for client initialization (newAdminClient, newCalendarClient, etc. currently at 0%)
5. Consider testing error handling paths and edge cases

## Security Improvements

### 4. Credential Management
- [ ] Document secure credential storage practices
- [ ] Add credential file permission checks (warn if world-readable)
- [ ] Consider system keychain integration
- [ ] Add environment variable support for credentials
- [ ] Document OAuth2 scope requirements

**Rationale:** Improve security posture for credential handling.

### 5. Input Validation
- [x] Add email address validation
- [x] Add phone number format validation
- [x] Add UUID format validation
- [x] Sanitize all user inputs
- [x] Add validation for department/group names

**Rationale:** Prevent invalid data and potential injection issues.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
Implementation details:
- Created `cmd/validation.go` with comprehensive validation functions:
  - `ValidateEmail()`: RFC 5322 compliant email validation with length checks
  - `ValidatePhoneNumber()`: Phone format validation supporting US/international formats
  - `ValidateUUID()`: UUID format validation using google/uuid package
  - `ValidateGroupName()`: Group name validation (alphanumeric, dots, hyphens, underscores)
  - `ValidateDepartment()`: Department name validation with 100 char limit
  - `SanitizeInput()`: Input sanitization removing null bytes and control characters
- Created `cmd/validation_test.go` with 93 test cases achieving 100% coverage
- Integrated validation into command handlers:
  - `user-create.go`: Email and group name validation
  - `user-update.go`: Email, phone, UUID, department, manager email, group validation
  - All user inputs sanitized before processing
- Added `github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0` dependency for UUID validation
- All tests passing (93 new validation tests + 36 existing tests)

### 6. Fix gosec Security Issues
- [x] **HIGH**: Fix weak RNG in password generation (`cmd/user.go:37`) - Use `crypto/rand` instead of `math/rand`
- [x] **MEDIUM**: Add file path validation for credential files (`cmd/client.go:92, 161, 182`) - Prevent directory traversal
- [x] **LOW**: Handle errors from `csv.Writer.Write()` (`cmd/user-list.go:120-125`)
- [x] **LOW**: Handle errors from `viper.BindPFlag()` (`cmd/root.go:40`)

**Rationale:** Fix security vulnerabilities identified by gosec scanner.

**Priority:** HIGH - Weak RNG for password generation is a critical security issue.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
Implementation details:
- **Password Generation**: Replaced `math/rand` with `crypto/rand` in `randomPassword()` function
  - Uses `crypto/rand.Int()` with `math/big` for cryptographically secure random number generation
  - Panics on crypto/rand failure (critical error condition)
- **File Path Validation**: Created `validateCredentialPath()` function in `cmd/client.go`
  - Validates paths are within user home directory or temp directory
  - Prevents directory traversal attacks by checking for ".." sequences
  - Resolves absolute paths and validates against allowed prefixes
  - Applied to all credential file operations (read, write, create)
- **CSV Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for `csv.Writer.Write()` operations
  - Checks errors for header write, each row write, and flush operations
  - Exits with descriptive error messages on failure
- **Viper Error Handling**: Added error handling for `viper.BindPFlag()` in root command initialization
  - Logs errors to stderr if flag binding fails
- **gosec Results**: 0 issues remaining (3 nosec annotations with justification for validated file operations)

## Code Quality

### 7. Remove Hardcoded Domain
- [x] Add `domain` field to configuration file (.google-admin.yaml)
- [x] Add `--domain` flag for command-line override
- [x] Update viper configuration to read domain setting
- [x] Replace hardcoded domain in functional code:
  - [x] `cmd/group-list.go:110` - Remove email filtering or make configurable
  - [x] `cmd/group-list.go:178, 202` - Use configured domain instead of hardcoded append
  - [x] `cmd/user-update.go:236` - Use configured domain for group insertion
  - [x] `cmd/user-create.go:21` - Update welcome email template to use configured domain
  - [x] `cmd/user-create.go:125` - Use configured domain for group insertion
- [x] Update all example email addresses in documentation to use example.com
- [x] Support default domain fallback for backward compatibility

**Rationale:** Currently a domain is hardcoded in functional code (auto-appending to group names, email filtering, welcome emails). This makes the tool non-reusable for other organizations. Making the domain configurable enables broader adoption while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
- Added `domain` configuration support via Viper with environment variable `GOOGLE_ADMIN_DOMAIN`
- Added `--domain` flag for command-line override
- Created `getDomain()` helper function with fallback logic
- Updated all functional code to use configured domain:
  - `cmd/group-list.go`: Email filtering and group name appending now use configured domain
  - `cmd/user-update.go`: Group insertion uses configured domain
  - `cmd/user-create.go`: Welcome email and group insertion use configured domain
- All documentation examples updated to use example.com
- Smart detection: if group name contains "@", doesn't append domain
- Build successful, all commands tested

### 8. Error Handling
- [ ] Implement structured logging (zerolog or zap)
- [ ] Add context to error messages
- [ ] Use error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w`
- [ ] Add log levels (debug, info, warn, error)

**Rationale:** Better debugging and error tracking.

### 9. CI/CD Modernization
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflows

- [ ] Migrate from Jenkins or run both in parallel

**Rationale:** Modernize CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and security scanning.

### 10. Documentation
